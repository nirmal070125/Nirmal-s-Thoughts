Using a PPA

You can use WebUpd8 PPA (this will download the required files from Oracle and install JDK 8):

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some “red flags” to watch out for?

Also ensure your JAVA_HOME variable has been set to:

/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
For this you can use the following command (see step 3 of Manual Install to see how to make it permanent):

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
